Summary of app requirements and user needs:
The app was designed to allow users to log in, manage data (like inventory or events), and receive SMS notifications, addressing needs for secure login, data management, and timely alerts.

Screens and features supporting user needs:
Key screens included login, data management (grid display), and permission prompts for SMS, with simple, intuitive navigation to ensure ease of use and accessibility for all users.

Approach to coding the app:
I approached coding with a modular, iterative strategy, utilizing reusable components, consistent naming conventions, and best practices for clear and maintainable code, which can be applied to future projects for efficiency.

Testing process for functionality:
I tested using the Android Emulator to ensure the login system, database interactions, and SMS permissions worked as intended, revealing areas for code refinement and highlighting potential user experience issues.

Innovation to overcome a challenge:
I had to innovate by implementing error handling for various scenarios, such as users denying SMS permissions, ensuring the app remained functional without it.

Component demonstrating success in knowledge, skills, and experience:
I was particularly successful in developing the secure login system with database integration, demonstrating both technical competence and attention to user needs for data security.
